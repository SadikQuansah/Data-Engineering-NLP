And the other review mentioning the pressure to buy in order to clear a board is right--takes all the fun out of it. I used to like to play, but it's gotten ridiculous. Vertical only just takes the cake. Dark ages, seriously\n",
      "I’m not sure if this is an update issue or not, but in the Las couple of days the game has stopped allowing my iPad from orienting in landscape.  That is my preferred way to play, and, until the last couple of days, I have always played the game in landscape mode.\n",

Like millions of others, I play CC on my iPad, and flipping the device sideways is inconvenient and not as much fun. So BUH-BYE.\n",
      "Please bring back the option to either play candy royale or not. I keep having to exit the application several times before the game resumes without that annoyance. I feel it’s a stupid feature. I hardly ever beat a level after the first try that’s why I don’t want to bother with it.\n",

I played this games with lifelong friends and i deleted it because YOU took landscape mode away. I have not only a phone but an ipad and I don’t like turning my devices, If you do it to soda ill say but bye to that game too\n",
      "I have been playing this game for years! I’ve completed over 10,000 levels. There have been updates along the way that haven’t been great but the absolute worst is forcing us to play Candy Royale. Why did you take away the option to x out of the game. It is obvious from reading the reviews that everyone hates it! I used to love playing Candy Crush but now when I open the game and I see Candy Royale I instantly swipe out of the game. This update makes me not want to play anymore!\n",
      "This game used to be fun but the algorithms are written to control outcomes. If it’s not truly based on chance, but on coercion to buy, it’s no longer a game.  Have deleted it and won’t play it ever again.\n",
      "It’s ok but the boosters r rare and some Levi’s take for ever\n",
      "I’ve been playing several years now and do not like being forced into joining the Candy Royale part of the game.  We used to be able to opt out, why did that change? And why are the prizes often temporary? I was much happier getting the hammer or swap prizes. So many people I used to play with have quit, maybe it’s time for me to look elsewhere as well.\n",
      "It used to be fun until greed got in the way. Now they govern how many lives you can use from the ones your friends give you. You used to could use them all if needed.  I’m seeing more cartoon friends who are clearing levels so fast you’ll have to spend money to catch up with them. It used to be just Facebook friends then they slowly started easing in the cartoon friends. They bots if you ask me. I don’t play it as much as i used to.\n",

      "Long time player of the game- maybe since it was released. The amount of pop ups these days is absolutely ridiculous and the time wasted from every other little pop trying to sell you something is absurd. I use the game as a time passer yes but I’m not trying to waste my time waiting for a small “X” to come up on 10 different boxes before I can finally start a game. I understand their trying to keep people on the app as long as possible and they’ve prolly done social/psych studies about it but this is terrible. Either add a do not disturb mode or something that can stop this nonsense or this game will officially meet its end on my phone.\n",

The rest of them are all in-game garbage like challenges, and friend requests, and races, and storylines no one cares about, and wheel spins, on and on and on with the pop ups. I have to close like 10 of them before I can even get to a level when I open the game, it’s absurd. Also there needs to be a way to stop friend requests. I’m assuming the ones I’m getting are some bot thing since I’m not linked in any way from Facebook or where-ever. I don’t care about friends and the stupid banner that you can’t push away and have to sit there and see “JESSE WANTS TO BE YOUR FRIEND!!!!!” is infuriating. But I do enjoy the game and deeply appreciate that there are no forced ads. I don‘t mind that the trade off is that high levels sometimes throw you an impossible-without-a-booster level. Boosters are easy enough to get for free either through the challenges/spins or ad-watching so it doesn’t bother me.\n",

Why? Because they are investigating a new account I created. Why did I creat a new account? Because the hacker was able to delete the sign in email and phone number to an email and number of their choice. So I created a new account using my email which if the hacker never deleted it would have triggered the creation of the new account using my email to notify me that the email already was associated with an account. But because the hacker deleted the email I was able to creat a second account using the same email and number So every time and will always be in the future fb will investigate and will conclude that my account is ok and is not hacked because they are reffereing to the 2nd new account not aware that my original account is not accessible unless they use the hackers credentials used after the hacker deleted my credentials CAN ANYONE HELP ME\n",

This time around I was barely ever on the app, nothing in my bio, no offensive pictures, and I hadn’t even matched with anyone in a couple of months. I go to get on the other day and swipe and I get the message my account has been banned…. Yet AGAIN. When I asked customer support why I was banned, the first response they tried telling me that there wasn’t even an account with my email. When I showed them the screenshotted message I got that said my account has been banned, this was their response, “ Hi, Thank you for your response and we're sorry we couldn’t be of more help in this situation.

      "I have played this game for a number of years, I bought a new iPad recently that is a 12 in which is much bigger than my previous one, my complaint is that it will only play in portrait mode, which is so difficult for me to hold it up in that mode rather than landscape \n",
      "So I had to delete it and not play anymore\n",
      "It is amazing and a shame. This is a enjoyable game, however recently just as it clear you are going to solve a level, with the help of the bonus moves, the advert locks up and doesn’t give you the moves. Clearly a ploy by the developer for you to make purchases to get rid of the adverts.\n",

      "My ads have all of a sudden completely disappeared. I’ve seen a lot of people complaining of the same thing. What’s the rationale, King? If the company think that people will start buying because they have no ads, they should think twice. Most of us - me for a fact - are more likely to quit playing than buying boosters. With the ads, at least King have an income and players don’t get stuck in nightmarishly hard levels for weeks. With players quitting, what’s in it for you?\n",

I hate this app as it doesn’t have anything from the ads. If you add them I will be so happy. If you don’t I will never download the game ever again so please put what is in the ads in the game. I will write another review when you have added it into the game but for now I have a bad review for you. \n",

Levels can’t be completed without using extra moves or help, which can be bought if you haven’t accrued them. A money making scheme. Oh who am I kidding, it’s not a charity. Just reinstall to get the fun back but don’t post a review because all the nicknames are taken\n",

It is all just down to plodding on and hoping for the right game board. Read somewhere this had been sold so, presumably, the new owners are trying to recoup their investment. All these super hard level with a badly drawn owl telling me that 87% of players needed to buy help to pass says it all. Refuse to pay anything as once they know you will pay you will never get past one of these levels ( which are becoming more frequent) until you pay up. That is a mugs game! Just using up my accumulated boosters (never ever paid for) and then time to delete. So many new games to choose from now. Totally spoiled through greed. You shouldn’t have paid so much for it!\n",

      "I have been playing this game since the start but feel I am being unfairly treated.I spend a lot on candy crush & when buying 10 bars went up to £1.99 I did not complain even though times can be hard with the cost of living.What hurts me is that I went onto my partners phone & you are still charging him £1.79.How is this fair?A response would be appreciated.\n",
      "This is an easy game to play but gets a bit repetitive and boring after a while. Particularly when it keeps you stuck on one level for eons waiting for you to give in and purchase add ons to enable you to move on. This starts to get really noticeable the longer you play the game and so the boredom then sets in!\n",
      "Used to love playing this game but as others have said, it seems like you get a hard level or extra hard level each time now and gets the poo t where I can’t be bothered to try and pass the level!  and why has the theme music changed, not relevant but Ive played with no sound because it just annoys me 😂\n",
      "I, like many others who have written a review below, have been playing this game for years. I’m sad to write this but I will be deleting this game because it has become so frustratingly hard that it is impossible to play. Too few moves allocated and too many objectives to complete renders the game unenjoyable and plum annoying. Thank you for occupying some bored times old friend but you aren’t the same thing I used to enjoy.\n",

Daily win when all days completed used to give you lollipop hammers etc, now it just gives you 15 minutes of boosters instead! It seems that you only get something worthwhile if you pay for it!! I also can’t access the lives given to me by friends as it doesn’t reset at midnight!! Why do updates never improve the game?? I won’t be playing anymore 🤨\n",
      "People relatively new to the game get lots of opportunities to watch ads etc for rewards, I have been playing for 3 years and around level 4300, I get literally 0 of those options. I just get paywalls and incredibly hard levels.\n",

      "Since the madman took over the app and Twitter have went down the toilet. If it doesn’t improve soon it will begetting deleted.\n",
      "If you feel like doom scrolling for hours and completely losing any waning traces of your faith in humanity, then oh boy, is this the app for you. Endless torrents of ads, bots, trolls and toxicity await. If your idea of free speech means being allowed to spread misinformation while spewing slurs of all types and telling people to kill themselves, look no further than Twitter. All the bigotry you could ever want, sometimes under the guise of faux concern but usually pure unadulterated malice. A real smorgasbord of hatred, between all the ads and promoted tweets of course, and if you’re lucky, you might even be able to see posts from people you actually follow. Eat the rich.\n",
      "Qtd going on with twitter I been 2 hours trying to open an account it’s like an join the FBI so hard the  the stupid verification so hard and I  wasn’t able to do it so deleted twitter and back to Facebook\n",

      "I am surprised that twitter needs a review, who dares ! I use twitter since my mind starts working, 10 years ago, i can survive without any of social media but not twitter, if u need a single app to sum all of the most important things about your friends or around the world, it’s Twitter. 🕊️🩵\n",
      "Can’t access my account it’s connected to my account, but it asks me to verify who I am and every time I do it just gives me an error message. Looked online and nothing seems to be able to help, the problem stops me from logging out my account, so can’t even do that. Tried uninstalling the app which still didn’t solve the problem. It needs fixed. I can only access twitter via the internet browser which is frustrating. Find a fox please!\n",
      "I’m new to social media so I apologise if I’m not the best with the abbreviations or what they mean, I just wanted to say that I think this one is pretty easy to use and I’m sure I’ll get better with the help from the people on here and the people who run it 🤟🏻\n",

      "This morning show, we had to watch disgusting views. Of a young woman seating there with her skirt so short, she should of been asked to cover up. There is need for it we wanted to injoy the show but we will never watch the programme again it’s funny how the other young ladies don’t do this disgusting\n",
      "Over the past year or so it’s become unusable for me. Violent and gore videos everywhere, replies clogged up with verified scammers and OF girls, constantly DMd and followed by bots, search often doesn’t work, quote tweets often don’t show, ads are often scams, way way more hateful and angry content making it a pretty depressing experience, reports going nowhere. Have deleted it, life is better without it.\n",
      "First time downloading & using Twitter, after much consideration as to whether I wanted to enter this world of over inflated opinions. My account was blocked/ locked/ put in purgatory within a matter of days after making only six replies/ responses to tweets (I made no open tweets, had no followers). Apparently I broke the shady-hazy rules around being ‘mean’ about someone who’ll never know. Honestly. Deleted app and stepped away. Elon, opinions can be mean without being hateful. Good luck with your cage fight fatso.\n",
      "Twitter one of great inventions.\n",
      "Let’s all use for good and enjoyment and in the way help and praise everyone you can.\n",
      "Today I noticed I couldn’t click on links, videos, images, posts or even ads on my feed. Completely unresponsive. Videos begin flashing and glitching whenever I try to expand them. Restarted my phone, it’s not the phone. The app is just broken\n",
      "Do not believe the hype. Twitter is still banning feee speech and promoting illicit activities\n",

      "Went from depressing but usable to depressing and unusable in the space of a couple of months, amazing what an ego tripping imbecile is capable of\n",
      "I am very disappointed by your behavior on Twitter and @elonmusk , that accounts of thousands of TLP workers are being suspended on a daily basis.  It is a restriction on freedom of expression that a political party is not allowed to raise its voice which it has the right to. So I think that Twitter is no longer the best platform for freedom of expression.  And I will share this thing with people so that they also stay away from it.\n",
      "Better than other platforms. When you think about it………..\n",
      "It would be a good app but it didn’t even let me create an account.after verification it said continue but after that it did nothing and took me back to the sign in screen.\n",
      "Excellent app\n",

      "Just awful. The world is burning. Id give it no stars if I could. TAX THE RICH.\n",
      "People match and never chat. Lots of ego boosters who prefer to be followed on their socials. App does not tell you how much likes you got left\n",
      "I’ve come back to Tinder plenty of times over the years and found meaningful relationships through it. It’s the perfect, simplified app for getting people in touch with one another. Don’t expect it to do the dating for you though! I know people complain about a lack of matches and the presence of bots etc but the Tinder team can’t force anybody to fall into your arms and they try their best to remove the bots promptly. Every dating app has the same issue but from my experience Tinder is the most responsive for banning these fake accounts. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve had relationships that have lasted a few months and some that have lasted 1 year+... again, they can’t do the dating for you, being mindful of how you present yourself and what you’re looking for is the best way to ensure you have an enjoyable experience. I like the fact that there’s a swipe limit because I do think that a lot of people just swipe right all day and expect matches to come flooding in.. be aware that doing this is a common mistake and it works to your detriment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Try and match with people who have something in common with you and are seeking the same outcome, otherwise you’re playing yourself! It’s the best app for turning online chatter into real meet ups and dates, don’t abuse it and you’ll surely have success. Be confident and open minded with the people you’re interacting with and for the love of God show respect, not every opportunity is going to materialise into something! \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall it’s the best app for dating, aside from the fact it’s so incredibly popular it’s functional and caters to everybody’s needs, so stay patient folks! Love is just around the corner!\n",
      "0 stars worst app ever may made\n",
      "It would be nice if Tinder had an option for gay men, and indeed women, to put their position on their profile, such as top, bottom, versatile etc, that would make life so much easier instead of having to talk to so many people for months and then find out you’re both bottoms and then have to start all over again.\n",
      "Not useful\n",
      "So much cawk\n",
      "Hardly any matches\n",
      "Tinder should vet profiles and pick out the false ones which are either scam artist or weirdos😂\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s worse that Grindr for those and that’s a pretty low bar😂😂\n",
      "I reset my account as I found that a lot of the people coming up were just repeats and I got banned. I understand that someone may have reported me thinking it was a fake account or that I was a bot but now there is no way for me to get my account back :(\n",
      "It basically shows your profile if it feels like it it seems like 😂 got 15 likes within the first hour then the next morning nothing. It just decides whether or not it wants to show your profile, in the hopes you’ll spend money on it. Very malicious\n",
      "I wouldn’t recommend this app, and I have paid for this app about seven months. It was a waste of money.\n",
      "A lot of fake profiles zero genuine matches after 3 month’s subscription\n",
      "If you’re anything other than an exceptionally good looking man, this app will just make you depressed and feel worthless. Don’t download, go outside, go to bars, meet people.\n",
      "Worse dating app going\n",
      "It’s not the best but I’m still here, not enough options to dweedle none starters out, no option for ethnicity preference which is important, and keeps deleting people off.\n",
      "Terrible app designed to leverage as much money as possible from men. I get a lot of likes initially and then nothing. Also, even though I got 50+ likes on the first day, I never get any matches no matter how many people I swipe right on. So tinder obviously isn’t showing my profile to anyone and won’t show me the profile of anyone who’s liked me so we can match! Why? Because I have paid any subscription. It’s a total scam & tinder is a toxic, dystopian nightmare. Avoid.\n",
      "Likes clear before they have been in the swiping selection or bots every second or third profile\n",
      "This app is all about money. They wont show you to anyone unless you pay. There are way better options than Tinder. Do not pay for Tinder plus or anything. Absolutely won’t recommend!\n",
      "The app is full of fake profiles. Bumble is much better.\n",
      "The amount of trans people on tinder is quite high. Whilst I really don’t want to offend anyone, I simply do not see trans women as women that I wish to date, I’d like children one day. It becomes tiresome seeing them as potential dates?!\n",
      "Mostly only fans girls and a disproportionate amount of photoshopped Asian women.\n",
      "I only get matched with overweight people and trans men. I’m not grateful\n",
      "Useless TINDER!!!!!\n",
      "Tinder is just a waste of time now- might as well state that it’s a card game cause all you do is get limited matches that then don’t talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now you are limited to how many likes you get unless you pay a ridiculous amount of money for the ‘gold’ and ‘platinum’ plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe focus on the actual product than making money- all you are doing is giving yourself a bad name\n",
      "I tried buying special stars in the app, was an error came up, and in the end I had purchased double the amount I wanted and it would’ve been cheaper just to subscribe to a higher tier package.\n",
      "There is no way to keep message notifications but turn off those spam notifications from tinder. This makes me so mad. This is why people just turn off notifications completely, due to this major bug (by design) in app\n",
      "Kept asking me for a review, very annoying\n",
      "For men it’s so much harder to find a match\n",
      "Some not so nice men on here! \n",
      " Brains behind their zip!\n",
      "I’ve had a few matches but only a few messages, full of time wasters, so far I’ve not met anyone\n",
      "Full of fake profiles - a lot of pretty people are always a) 3km away from me and b) are unverified…strange that? \n",
      "You match with people that you’ve never seen and never get a match with anyone you do like. I’ve matched with people who I know have matched with me and yet…no match occurs…strange that. It’s almost like something is blocking the conversation. \n",
      "\n",
      "To be honest I’m about done with it because it doesn’t work, and it used to be so good…a bit like how YouTube used to be good but now 🤷‍♂️ it’s a bit rubbish.\n",
      "It would appear unless you spend money on the app boosts etc not a lot happens . Not impressed\n",
      "Não pague o gold \n",
      "O aplicativo tem muitas falhas, não há assistência técnica, apenas mensagens informativas com grandes textos que mandam você somente reiniciar o app e não resolve nada. Já foi bom o app\n",
      "How can you possibly justify increasing the monthly gold plan from £29.49 to £43.99 a month in a matter of a week? \n",
      "Huge jump Tinder.\n",
      "As with all dating apps full of time wasters who never reply, don’t bother.\n",
      "The service has improved .. it was appalling before but the feees r far to high and it’s not value for money\n",
      "Too many additional costs if you want to get the most out of it\n",
      "Terrible, too many ads, trying to get you to pay even more money for boosting profile biggest con ever\n",
      "As the title\n",
      "Like many other reviews you will see. I was banned for no reason, given no explanation. \n",
      "No review process ever actually in your favour you just get banned for life. I refuse to get another phone number just to use this app. My recommendation - go to a pub or shopping centre, your chances of meeting someone you like are a hell of a lot bigger.\n",
      "I havnt even been able to get on the app as my number has been shadow banned because i dont reach the age requirements. I created an account like 10 mins before i turned 18 and ive not being able to create an account ever since. In the 6 months thats gone by i still cant create an account and the tinder support were useless not listening to a word i was saying and telling me to press a button that isnt even there.\n",
      "I use to like tinder when I had unlimited swipes for less than 5 pounds a month but now I cancelled the service after starting to see someone but come back to it now, the service itself has gone up to 11 pounds a week for the same subscription but with even less functions. Basically you pay for it one month, maybe you settle an cancel it an then you come back a little later down the line the membership has tripled and the abilities you use to have now cost extra £2 a go for rewinds, boosts etc. all just one big gimmick really what happened to 5 a month an you get to swipe. Not to mention that there’s nearly no real nice accounts to look at it’d help if there wasn’t so much fake to sift through\n",
      "Banned out of the blue, now banned on every other Match.com account.\n",
      "DO NOT PUT ANY MONEY INTO THIS!\n",
      "I tested a few theories with this app, its a money making scam. As a free user you’ll have a lot of someone liked you, so it keeps you on to see if you match, as soon as you pay, that stops as the app knows you are premium and they cant cover their false claims, so the likes stop for you, soon as your premium runs out, guess what.. 16likes you can not see!\n",
      "\n",
      "They’re all fake asian profiles anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do yourself a favour, go out and meet people :)\n",
      "I don’t know what the ratio is, or whether different genders have varying techniques to online dating, but as a women there are many many options and a bunch of people will swipe right on you.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, you really have to put time in to skim through who is looking for a hookup, who wants a relationship etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most people on tinder hold shocking conversation or have terrible/group photos, but that is not necessarily tinders fault. In fact it makes use of the app entertaining to play guess who’s profile it is. I guess if you like judging people this would be a good app for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have had, in my several on and off stints, about 2 good connection dates (and I’m real fussy). So tinder can in fact perform its primary function of helping you meet people. \n",
      "\n",
      "My one star deduction comes from the swiping interface as it has previously thought I’d super liked people when I wanted to reject them. Leading to much awkwardness and a one year relationship.\n",
      "Tinder needs to do more about fake profiles. Whilst it may be impossible to completely get rid of fake profiles, there are significantly more than on every other dating app I’ve tried. What’s worse is the blue tick verified profile is meaningless. I’ve encountered many a catfish and fake profile/ scammer that is supposedly verified. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other than that. It’s a very easy to use app.\n",
      "Tinder is deliberately hiding people who have liked my profile until I run out of likes and then they’re right there. Soon as i have likes again they’re nowhere to be seen again. It’ll go on like this for weeks.\n",
      "PAY TO WIN PAY TO WIN PAY TO WIN PAY TO WIN PAY TO WIN PAY TO WIN PAY TO WIN PAY TO WIN\n",
      "Banned for no apparent reason after paying for upgrading. Nobody to contact, no reason for ban. It’s a con.\n",
      "I realised dating apps are designed to profit off of lonely men by pandering to narcissistic women. Morally questionable capitalism is what I would call it. Go out and talk to strangers instead, more often than not you’ll find people of much higher quality.\n",
      "The game just updated and completely wiped my entire profile ….. I was at like level 1200\n",
      "I have not update Candy Crush app for long time, Recently let my ipad do the update (just yesterday), and found out the app now only allow me to use with Portrait view, which not only limited my level map view, but I have to put my device upward rather than laying it sideways, which make things uncomfortable. Went search online, found that developers do that on purpose.  Please put the classical landscape view back to the app.\n",
      "What the hell? My app has been frozen all day…\n",
      "And I can’t pick a nickname because everything has been taken. Must be your way of making sure you don’t get a bad review.\n",

      "You can’t pass some levels until you spend money…..I don’t like it\n",
      "The mechanics of the fish power up and now instead of them being useful power ups they are things you work to avoid as they don’t actually help. They randomly hit rather than clearing something you need now. Oh well the rest of the game is awesome just annoyed about this one mechanic change.\n",

The map layout also sucks now, the old one was way better. FIX THIS!!! will most likely delete is this isn’t fixed. Also the watch ads for extra moves and the ufo thing are gone and makes the game wayyyyy worse.

There is also a lot of bugging now on many functionalities and it doesn’t run as smooth. Also, many functionalities have not picked up and were frowned upon by users, but many can be better thought out and more stimulating. I sure hope that META allows us a perfect archive before we lose everything - and we have in the past when technical adjustments were being made - or that we can transfer everything (unlikely) as is onto a new vibrant platform !

Then somewhere along the way, Facebook decided it would be a good idea to become like other apps and offer services like dating, buy & sell, subscription, reels, store pages, etc., trying to be all apps in one. This has created a bloated experience where I can’t see my friends content because I have to scroll through all this garbage in the way.

      "I’m pretty convinced that Tinder discriminates against people they deem undesirable and shouldn’t be part of their sexual pool, and they unleash fake accounts that sell sexual services against the people they discriminate against. When I first joined, the service seemed normal, but soon after, every woman I matched with turned out to be a fake account, and then I got liked often by only fake accounts that are selling sexual services. There was no possibility for me to simply date. It is very easy to screen out fake accounts. They all contain a link to a social media service like Instagram or Snapchat. I’m not sure why Tinder doesn’t ban them. This is easy to automate. That’s why I’m convinced they actually fund them to discriminate against certain users and then shadow ban them from contact with normal users or troll them to waste their time by unleashing countless fake accounts against them, none of which are willing to date for free. This is unacceptable. I’m pretty sure I have a lawsuit on my hand. If a company even discriminates against one person on earth, they’re liable for their discrimination and oughta pay damages while preventing further discrimination or otherwise must go out of business due to becoming illegal for their discrimination. We all know that shadow banning at Twitter turned out to be true. I noticed similar behavior in all Match Group dating services. Many of them were better before getting bought out by Match Group, which was probably done to control the online sexual dating pool through discrimination. I had no issues before Match Group assimilated their various dating companies. I’m glad I made this connection to avoid the entire group of discriminatory dating services, but what they do is still illegal and they oughta get sued out of business over it as part of banning discriminatory behavior against customers in all businesses.\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the major issues I encountered with Tinder is the prevalence of fake profiles. It seems that a significant portion of the user base consists of bots or individuals with dishonest intentions. This made it incredibly difficult to find genuine and authentic connections. The lack of effective measures to combat fake profiles was disheartening and diminished the overall user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the app's algorithm for matching and suggesting potential partners often fell short of expectations. It often seemed that the suggested matches were not aligned with my preferences or criteria, leading to a sense of frustration. The lack of customization options and the reliance on superficial attributes further hindered the chances of finding compatible matches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another concern with Tinder is the issue of harassment and inappropriate behavior. Despite efforts to curb such behavior, instances of unsolicited messages, explicit content, and disrespectful interactions were all too common. This created an uncomfortable and unsafe environment for users, especially for women, who often faced unwanted advances and inappropriate comments.\n",

      "Moreover, the premium features and subscription pricing of Tinder left me dissatisfied. While the free version of the app offered limited functionality, the additional features unlocked by the paid subscription did not justify the cost. The value-for-money aspect was questionable, and it felt like the app was primarily focused on monetization rather than improving the user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the customer support and responsiveness of Tinder were lacking. When encountering issues or seeking assistance, the support team's response time was often slow, and the solutions provided were generic and unhelpful. This lack of reliable support added to the overall frustration and dissatisfaction with the app.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, my experience with the Tinder app has been underwhelming. The presence of fake profiles, inadequate matching algorithms, issues of harassment, questionable pricing, and unsatisfactory customer support have all contributed to my negative perception of the app. I believe there is significant room for improvement in creating a safer, more genuine, and user-centric environment for individuals seeking meaningful connections.\n",
      "Keeps crashing.\n",
      "It’s a amazing game but the annoying thing about the game is that you lose life so easily and also when you lose you have to wait for you to play again so the thing you should do is make more lives because that way it’s better and if you’re not very hard level you should add more moves instead of less you because then you make it really frustrating\n",
      "Used to be good but getting worse - the new update makes the game unplayable as the targets are no longer identifiable as what’s on the board.  Also agree with the longer bad review here about not getting correct ‘bonuses’.  It’s addictive and interesting but basically money-hungry and deceitful.  Nothing is in your control in this game.\n",

      "1. Yeah I even don't want to spend a cent but gold bars are now totally impossible to get but why? There's no Episode Race, which is probably the only way to get gold bars, why? Features randomly appear and disappear time to time and device to device.\n",
      "2. Why did you remove interesting names such as \"Chocolate Barn\"? It was used to be fun but now really lonely, with only a few episodes having unique names. Please, bring it back, people will be excited, I know the reason why: it is to save memory. But I don't care about the memory of my phone. Thank you. 👍\n",
      "They have no respect for long time player as making the game crash when you are about to complete the level. It shuts down the app and you loose the heart!!!Where does all the money go not fixing the bugs??\n",
      "Enjoyed and interesting. \n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "I’ve been playing for years but over the past 3 months it’s impossible to pass levels without using tonnes of resources and spending money. Each section now has multiple “extreme” levels so you can never get ahead and accrue resources. It’s so money grabbing and awful. I’m done.\n",
      "The game itself is very addictive. But the app seems to crash and shutdown with ridiculous frequency. Rapidly losing patience.\n",
      "Why will Candy Crush not load? Even after deleting and starting again.\n",
      "They took away the good stuff in the update. The app keeps on crashing whilst I’m playing. Especially frustrating when I’m about to win and I’m kicked out of the game and have to restart again. ‘Swipe away stress’ what a joke.\n",

      "So annoying when friends send lives you can only claim 20 lives a day change it back where we can play unlimited times!!!\n",
      "Really disappointed in the game makers. How can you defeat levels where you need to remove 90+ reinforced candies with only 11 - 20 moves? This is especially the case on hard levels where there is no way you can complete it in the allotted moves. Not only that, the rewards you win for winning seven scrolls is cheaper store items!  Just money grabbing tactics and sad to say I have deleted the game and will not be back. It never use to be that way. If I could I would give it no stars!\n",
      "Having issues seeing friends list and sending requests / lives since new update. Please fix!\n",
      "Your time and I know what you mean you made me feel good to play with you and I’m just thinking about you guys and you guys are just so much nice to me I love your …smile and I’m just so happy you guys are the…best\n",

      "I'm over level 4000 but am over the fact that you just shut down the free spin or the ladder as and when you like the game was fun when you actually got a spin and won something but now it just seems you need to spend the cash to progress\n",
      "Candy Crush is my stress reliever . Super love it ❤️\n",
      "I don't like new update about receive lives from friends. Why it said up to 200 lives and I collect 20 heart lives a day then 180 left and can't get it until next day 20 lives.\n",
      "Nice game, nice graphics with cute characters and story lines. You get hooked on the first few hundred levels. Then as you keep watching ads to get help and lives, this game starts to get frustrating as some ads don’t help, or you don’t get as many lives as the game offers. The levels repeat themselves. The easy ones are fun and relaxing, then the hard ones get annoying as you repeat them over & over! If you get help, lucky you, the game flies into the next level and you begin to wonder ‘what a fluke, how did I pass?’.\n",
      "Once you get stuck on a level and no help…it’s time to really beat the stress! Better to delete it and find a less stressful time waster. I don’t waste money on these games, why should anyone!!! Don’t people pay enough to use the internet these games are already sucking my credit dry and either way you won’t get far. Still can’t understand how people are so clueless, they pay to be included in forums (morons). Overseas the internet is free! Anyway happy gaming to the “Pros” out there.\n",
      "So disappointed \n",
      "Now the game doesn’t allow to use all the extra lives sent by my friends \n",
      "Can someone explain me why ?\n",
      "It’s my choice to use or not my extra lives \n",
      "If I want to use all 20 in one day should be my choice \n",
      "So annoying\n",
      "Very interesting when reach to a new level. It’s a good fun game…\n",
      "Would love to know how you are supposed to get level 532 tried every combo still can’t fathom it out… any ideas please..\n",
      "If ads are what we have to have to get the few extra special bits and pieces we need when we need them, fix this thing going on where you sit through the inane thing and THEN  it tells you the ‘Ad is not available’,, and you get no benefit. It’s either a horrible flaw or a con, and the more it happens, the less I’m inclined to open the app and come back. Fix it and I’ll pop over for a better review.\n",
      "Games come and go but this one has stayed because it’s graphics are beautiful, it’s variety on each level is new and it’s a fun and easy game to play….however, I’m at level 236 and for the life of me I have tried every which way to pass but after 20 try’s there doesn’t seem to be ANY combinations of moves to pass UNLESS you pay money which I haven’t done but I’m thinking it’s the only way to pass this level. I feel sad as I write this review because I’m going to have to delete this game that has seen the test of time over the last 10 years simply because I’m being manipulated into coughing up money to continue playing. King…get it into your thick head that there are copies of candy crush and they are pretty much the same so your upset fans will just move across to your competition. Candy crush has just become a version of the pokies manipulating addictive personality’s into spending money they don’t have on useless ‘extra moves’ or ‘additional lives’. Sad…..\n",

      "Love it, but just recently the game won’t start, it crashes and goes back to the icon on the desktop.  I’ve done the update but it still does it!!  Why??\n",
      "I have played Candy Crush for over 10yrs and loved it but recently the changes to the game preventing using 20 extra lives when you have 200+ accumulated is extremely frustrating. Need this update removed or so many fans will discontinue playing. Disappointed candy crush developers!\n",

      "The game keeps crashing, especially when your on a winning streak and have the power ups. The game just shuts down and you lose everything when you re open it\n",
      "Don’t play this game unless you want to spend a substantial amount of your hard earned money. This game is incredibly addictive. Initially they make it easy to win in the levels up to around the first 1000 by then your actually brainwashed. then you need to dig deep for your hard earned cash only to have the game constantly crash at a vital point of the game loosing lives and boosters. Some of the levels are ridiculously stupid like getting yellow candy or chocolate blocks without enough moves to have even a chance therefore requiring the purchase of more lives and boosters. So you purchase and get ahead and bang the game crashes.  Do yourself a favour don’t get it!! This company and the like are nothing but thieves.\n",

You agree to the listing price, confirm the pick up time & address & then they sell to someone else who offers more.  Yesterday I drove for half an hour to pick up something & they messaged me 3 minutes before the organised time to tell me they sold it to someone else who ‘offered more when I told them you were coming’.  I got the message when I was outside her house!  An hour drive there & back and over $10 in tolls for nothing!  Sellers do this all the time & the rating system is completely insufficient to warn buyers about them…& as such there is no reason for them to do the right thing.  There needs to be a comment section where you can write exactly what they have done.  I have also reported someone before for selling a broken robot vac which was conveniently out of battery on pick up…they swore then & afterwards that it was in perfect condition even when I sent a video of the terrible noise it was making as soon as I got home & it had charged.  Nothing gets done when these people are reported!  And your customer service is completely non-existent.  Please do better.\n",

      "I’m aware that this may be a old update but Facebook is just making a mess of things with they’re option of grouping comments in three categories. The sponsored ads are so overboard at this rate. Facebook is not about connecting you with ‘people that matter’, but instead it’s primary purpose is data mining and keeping you hooked with the sponsored ads. Also, Facebook is terrible and has been for a long time, at recovering hacked accounts. They have no interest in recovering them whatsoever; from my experience, even with ample time.\n",
      "I have had a business account with Facebook for many years, it used to be valuable to advertise with them. But the platform is now so glitchy; sometimes promotions work though more often not, and the traffic that flows from the ads is often fake. Plus my business account continually receives spam and fb makes it very difficult to control the spammers. In addition my posts are no longer shown to many of my followers, resulting in low traffic. As a social media platform it’s defunct, the precinct of the ageing boomer generation. I only kept it because of my business account, & I’m really not sure why I’m keeping that now. There are far better platforms to invest your money in. Facebook is done.\n",

      "When I first created my account it told me I was not of age (18). This went on for about a year. Tinder customer support told me that I was banned even though I hadn’t even go to use my account?!!! Then I finally got to make account with the same phone number after about a year of trying again. Then this week it logged me out randomly and said it was an issue with log in details, tried to log back in and it tells me I’m not 18. For reference I’m 19 and turning 20 at the end of the year. Again tried to contact tinder support and was again told that I had been banned!!!! I have not put anything inappropriate or contacted anyone in a wrongful manner. In fact I haven’t even made conversation with someone because this app has given me the chance to use it. Terrible customer support. Either this app/service is terrible or it’s broken. Have had no issue with hinge or bumble. Not to mention I have purchased tinder gold. So at this point they’re grabbing my money and leaving. Get your act together and instead of having bot reply’s on email actually help the customer understand why this is happening. Telling the customer they are banned even though the account is locked because apparently I am underage is terrible. I’d like to actually talk to someone instead of a automated response!\n",

      "Deleted and never coming back.\n",
      "Still the best dating app for quick hook ups in my opinion but Tinder has become a pop-up nightmare! So many people to swip through and being stopped every 15 seconds for guessing games and others make it a but frustrating. For men I understand it can be quite worthwhile but as a woman we get to match mist of the time anyway so just want to be able to swipe through all these new faces quickly. Wish there was a « turn off pop-ups » button.\n",
      "Waaaaaaay too many scammers. People should be kicked out if they don’t verify their photo after one month\n",
      "Tinder is so incredibly broken. Full of fake profiles or influencers with their Instagram accounts desperate for followers. Not a genuine person on the app. Every now and then, every message and match disappears with no way to get into contact for support. Tinder is the biggest rip off.\n",
      "Tinder was pretty good despite a lot of bugs and the fact that I got banned for no reason it said for violating community guidelines but when I reached out they never told me what part I violated because I didn’t know I even violated any, despite some messages disappearing too the app was pretty good.\n",
      "Everyone is frozen. I can’t like or unlike anyone. I can't do anything after I paid for subscription.\n",

      "One of the worst dating apps. Shows you fake likes on the first day so that you’re tempted to see who liked you and then makes you pay to see that and after that the like goes away automatically.

I also have a dead profile I cannot unmatch from - when I try the app says it can’t connect. Event reporting to support through the app states it cannot connect so I cannot get either problem sorted.

      "Update: after making a complaint through BBB, I received confirmation from Tinder that someone had falsely reported me for something so severe (they won’t disclose) that I have been blocked for life without warning. They have no evidence, they asked no questions. Just took this false accusation as the truth no questions, no investigation, nothing. So heads up all to anyone that wants to block anytime for life, just report them for a severe violation. Job done, it’s that easy. Who’s the real victims here??? \n",

Yes I have read through the policy as your continuous and unhelpful auto response suggests. I have reached out to support who will not help. They will not investigate. They can’t even tell me what the violation apparently is. I was getting error messages after an upgrade to Gold. Then an hour later banned for life, then banned for life in hinge also. In a world where options to meet people are limited. For some this is quite a blow to opportunities to find love. Especially when this banning is not only for life but with no reason, no violation, no support from tinder, nothing. Surely you can see there is a problem by the multiple reviews stating the exact same thing, I can see this has been going on for years, why would you not see there is clearly something wrong here??? Can you assist? Can you investigate? Can you even tell me what this apparent violation is?? Can you give me a contact of an actual person that will assist?

This was very suspicious and unexpected as I had hardly been using that app in that period of time. I suspect a crazy ex has got her friends to report me every time they came across my profile… I messaged the Tinder team to get assistance to resolve this issue but they have just left me on read ever since with 0 assistance! Very disappointing and poor management skills from this app developer as they clearly can’t resolve customer issues!!\n",
      "I’ve had tinder for years now and it hasn’t been a great experience all round but lately all the matches I get are onlyfans accounts. I had downloaded the app to try find someone and all I get are onlyfan accounts and Insta personalities trying to get people to subscribe to their onlyfans account and to get more followers on Insta. I would get excited to see that I had a match and when I get on there it’s just the same stuff. Either an Instagram account trying to get another follower or an onlyfans subscription. And it is pretty disheartening when you try to make the best profile you can and for you to only match with people that aren’t there to meet but are there to sell themselves. I wouldn’t recommend this app to anyone.\n",

It’s a great strategy and avoiding all unknown and unexpected messages everyday. I have made few good friends even hang out with. Well, a place to find yourself to be loved and I am sure not in my country. Somewhere in this world he will match my profile. Can’t wait to swipe to right to interesting people around the world. \n",
